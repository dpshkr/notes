Fermi level ($E_F$), work function ($\Phi_F$), and electron affinity ($\chi_A$) are very important parameters for every electronic material
be it metal, semiconductor or even an insulator. 

*Work function* is defined as the energy required to remove an electron in the metal at the Fermi level to a ***point in vacuum just outside the metal***. 
The electron that we intend to remove from the metal must be at Fermi level. 
Further the final destination of the electron must be just outside the metal, 
sufficiently far so that the atomic forces of the metal on the electron are negligible, but no farther !

$$\Phi_F = E_0 - E_F$$

where $E_0$ is the energy of the electron in vacuum, just outside the metal.

1. An electron always has a lower energy inside the metal, compared to the vacuum. This is the reason why, the electron prefers to stay inside the metal. As a result, work function of a metal is always positive.
